# My Personal Project

## MyCourses Application

- What will the application do?  

    The application can creat a list of courses that users have taken before. Users also can put some information of ecah course like the **course name**, the **professor's name**, and the **user's grade of the course** (the grade on a scale of 0 to 100).
    
- Who will use it? 

    Any student who has taken courses in any school (but all of these courses must be taken in the same school) can use this application to help them to record their courses. 

- Why is this project of interest to you? 
    
    I would like to have an application that can give me a clear summary of courses that I've taken. For example, the application can show all names of courses such that it's easy to notice that which courses I need to take in order to meet the requirements of graduation in the future. I also can use this application to record my grades and calculate the average grade of all courses, which is useful for monitoring my grades.
